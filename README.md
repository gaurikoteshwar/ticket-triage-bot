# 🤖 Customer Support Ticket Triage Bot

## About the Project

This is a **Streamlit-based ticket triage app** designed to help customer support teams quickly classify incoming tickets, predict their urgency, and suggest professional responses.  

It uses **Llama 2 via Hugging Face** to analyze the text of each ticket, making it easy to:  

- Automatically categorize tickets (Billing, Technical, Account, Shipping, Other)  
- Predict urgency (High, Medium, Low)  
- Generate short, professional response suggestions  

The app is lightweight and customizable: you can use **local Llama 2 models** or **Hugging Face hosted models**. It is ideal for experimenting with **small-scale generative AI applications** in customer support.
